# CIS 5660 HW03 Procedural Buildings

## Overview
In this project, I created a procedural multi-floor building generator in Houdini.

Since I am very new to Houdini, I was mostly sticking to the provided tutorial. Overwatch is actually my favorite game so I was very happy with the style!

### Box Stacking & Details

The first part involves creating a custom HDA that stacks buildings on top of each other. Then details including window, door and balcony models are randomly added to the walls.

### Pillar

Pillar are then added to the building by placing boxes on the corners of each floor.

### Support

Finally, supports are added for floors that extend outwards.
